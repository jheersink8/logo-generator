# Logo-Generator
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/jheersink8/logo-generator 

## Description

To see a demonstration of this tool, please watch this video: 

This tool is used to generate simple .SVG files through the CLI that contain a shape and text. The user can choose from three shapes and set the color for the shape and the text. This tool is meant to demonstrate a working knowledge of:

- Node.js
- The inquirer npm
- Testing/Jest
- Classes
- Constructor functions
- Inheritance

## Installation
- Install Node.js using the download link above if itâ€™s not already installed 
- Using GitBash (or your preferred CLI), navigate to the folder you want to clone the repo to and run: git clone https://github.com/jheersink8/logo-generator
- Open the repo using VS Code
- From the VS Code terminal run the command: npm install inquirer @8.2.4 
- From the VS Code terminal run the command: npm install jest
- From the VS Code terminal, CD into the directory which contains index.js
- Run the command: node index.js

## Usage
After invoking the node index.js command, the user will be presented with four questions: 
- Type out your logo text (up to three characters):',
- Type your desired text color (either the color keyword or the hexidecimal value):',
- Select the shape for your logo:',
- Type your desired shape color (either the color keyword or the hexidecimal value):',

Each question has validation built in so that the user cannot enter an invalid input. Once all four questions have been answered, an .SVG file will be generated in the examples folder with the naming convention of (shape-color)-(shape)_(text). The .SVG file can then be viewed in a browser or opened in any image viewer that can view .SVG files.
